CSS Learning Journey - Rough Sheets and Practice Files.



Welcome to my CSS Learning Journey repository! Here, you'll find a collection of rough sheets, practice files, and resources that I've used while learning CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This repository serves as a personal archive of my progress, allowing me to track my growth and share my learning journey with others.

Within this repository, you can explore various CSS concepts, including selectors, properties, layouts, responsive design, animations, and more. The files are organized into different folders, each representing a specific topic or project I've worked on during my learning process.
